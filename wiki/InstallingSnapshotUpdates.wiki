#summary How to Install Snapshot Updates for the KnitML Editor

= Instructions =

  * Unzip the snapshot update (ZIP file) into the editor's plugin directory. For instance, if you installed the editor at C:\gpec-0.2.0, unzip it into C:\gpec-0.2.0\plugins. Make sure you use folder names when you unzip.
  * The next time you run the editor, run it with the -clean option. You can either create a shortcut from the executable file and add the "-clean" option to it, or you can open a shell window in the editor's home directory and run it by typing:
{{{
  knitmlEditor -clean
}}}
