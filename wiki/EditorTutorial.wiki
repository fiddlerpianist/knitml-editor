= Introduction =
Here is a crash course tutorial for writing patterns in the KnitML Pattern Editor.

= Install an Example =
From the File menu, select "New..." which will pop up a dialog box (it might take a moment). Click on the + sign next to the Examples folder in the list, select the example you want to look at, click the Next button, then Finish. If you don't already have a pattern open, the example pattern will open in the editor.

The current examples are:
  * a simple pattern
  * a stitch sampler
  * a basic sock
  * an advanced sock
  * a lace shawl (Foliage by Emilee Mooney)
  * a sweater (Banff by Jenna Wilson)

= Working with Patterns =
== The Outline ==
== Formatting ==
Control-Shift-F will format the pattern with proper indentation and spacing.
== Suggestions ==
If you're not sure what to type next, try typing Control-Space anywhere in the pattern. This will give you suggestions 

== Errors ==
If the computer can't understand your pattern, you'll get one or more red X marks with a circle in them on the left margin. If you move your mouse over one of these marks, a little bubble will pop up with description of the error. If a light bulb appears underneath the red X, the editor has some suggestions for fixing the error.

Some errors, such as structural grammar errors, can occur as you type. Some errors (such as errors that occur when test knitting the pattern) occur only when you save the pattern.

== Other controls ==
These are common editor controls that work in the editor:
Control-S: save the pattern
Control-F: find / replace text
Control-C: copy text
Control-X: cut text
Control-V: paste text
Right click (a.k.a. secondary click): pop-up menu with additional options


= Elements of the Pattern =
== The Header ==
Each pattern has a header section which contains information such as the name of the pattern, a description, and the author. It also contains information about what is needed to knit the pattern (needles, yarn, stitch holders, etc.)

Here is an example header:
{{{
Pattern name: "Simple Pattern"
Description: "A simple pattern"
Gauge: 5 st/in, 7 row/in
Author: "Joe Smith"
Yarn:
	25 g of "Terri's Handspun" (worsted weight)
Needles:
	Size 1 US circular
		Needle-One "Needle 1"

}}}

== The Directions ==
=== Starting Out ===
Most patterns start with a cast on. For instance, to start with 20 stitches, you would type:
{{{
Cast on 20 sts
}}}
If you use more than one needle in the pattern, however, you might first need to indicate which needles to start with:
{{{
Use Needle-One
}}}
If it's obvious to the knitter which needle to use and you are just telling the computer (remember, computers are incredibly dumb), you can put it in parentheses:
{{{
(Use Needle-One)
}}}
When you use the two next to each other:
{{{
(Use Needle-One)
Cast on 20 sts
}}}
this will look something like "Using Needle One, cast on 20 stitches" when the final (i.e., rendered) pattern is produced.

=== Rows ===
Directions which describe how to work stitches occur within a row.
{{{
Row 1: knit to end
Row 2: knit to end
Row 3: repeat [k2, p2] to end
Row 4: repeat [k2, p2] to 2 before end, p2
}}}

You can define short rows:
{{{
Short Row: k10, turn
Short Row: k10
}}}


Most directions in a knitting pattern are centered around where the working yarn is relative to the needles. 
=== Instructions ===
An instruction is a group of rows that are meant to be worked together. By
