= Introduction =
Here is a crash course tutorial for the new editor.

= Install an Example =
From the File menu, select "New..." which will pop up a dialog box (it might take a moment). Click on the + sign next to the Examples folder in the list, select the example you want to look at, click the Next button, then Finish. If you don't already have a pattern open, the example pattern will open up in the editor.

The current examples are:
  * a simple pattern
  * a stitch sampler
  * a basic sock
  * an advanced sock
  * a lace shawl (Foliage by Emilee Mooney)
  * a sweater (Banff by Jenna Wilson)

= Working with Patterns =
== The Outline ==
== Formatting ==
Control-Shift-F will format the pattern with proper indentation and spacing.
== Errors ==
If the computer can't understand your pattern, you'll get one or more red X marks with a circle in them on the left margin.

== Other controls ==
Control-F: find / replace
Control-C: copy
Control-X: cut
Control-V: paste

= Elements of the Pattern =
== The Header ==
Each pattern has a header section which contains information such as the name of the pattern, a description, and the author. It also contains information about what is needed to knit the pattern (needles, yarn, stitch holders, etc.)

== The Directions ==
=== Starting Out ===
Most patterns start with a cast on. For instance, to start with 20 stitches, you would type:

`Cast on 20 sts`

If you use more than one needle in the pattern, however, you might first need to indicate which needles to start with:

`Use Needle-One`

If it's obvious to the knitter which needle to use and you are just telling the computer (remember, computers are incredibly dumb), you can put it in parentheses:

`(Use Needle-One)`

When you use the two next to each other:
{{{
(Use Needle-One)
Cast on 20 sts
}}}
this will look something like "Using Needle One, cast on 20 stitches" when the final (i.e., rendered) pattern is produced.
