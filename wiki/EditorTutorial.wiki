= Introduction =
Here is a crash course tutorial for the new editor.

= Install an Example =
From the File menu, select "New..." which will pop up a dialog box (it might take a moment). Click on the + sign next to the Examples folder in the list, select the example you want to look at, click the Next button, then Finish. If you don't already have a pattern open, the example pattern will open in the editor.

The current examples are:
  * a simple pattern
  * a stitch sampler
  * a basic sock
  * an advanced sock
  * a lace shawl (Foliage by Emilee Mooney)
  * a sweater (Banff by Jenna Wilson)

= Working with Patterns =
== The Outline ==
== Formatting ==
Control-Shift-F will format the pattern with proper indentation and spacing.
== Errors ==
If the computer can't understand your pattern, you'll get one or more red X marks with a circle in them on the left margin. If you mouse over this error, 

== Other controls ==
These are common editor controls that work in the editor:
Control-F: find / replace
Control-C: copy
Control-X: cut
Control-V: paste
Right click (a.k.a. secondary click): pop-up menu with additional options


= Elements of the Pattern =
== The Header ==
Each pattern has a header section which contains information such as the name of the pattern, a description, and the author. It also contains information about what is needed to knit the pattern (needles, yarn, stitch holders, etc.)

Here is an example header:
{{{
Pattern name: "Simple Pattern"
Description: "A simple pattern"
Gauge: 5 st/in, 7 row/in
Author: "Joe Smith"
Yarn:
	25 g of "Terri's Handspun" (worsted weight)
Needles:
	Size 1 US circular
		Needle-One "Needle 1"

}}}

== The Directions ==
=== Starting Out ===
Most patterns start with a cast on. For instance, to start with 20 stitches, you would type:
{{{
Cast on 20 sts
}}}
If you use more than one needle in the pattern, however, you might first need to indicate which needles to start with:
{{{
Use Needle-One
}}}
If it's obvious to the knitter which needle to use and you are just telling the computer (remember, computers are incredibly dumb), you can put it in parentheses:
{{{
(Use Needle-One)
}}}
When you use the two next to each other:
{{{
(Use Needle-One)
Cast on 20 sts
}}}
this will look something like "Using Needle One, cast on 20 stitches" when the final (i.e., rendered) pattern is produced.


=== Rows ===


=== Instructions ===
An instruction is a group of rows that are meant to be worked together. By
