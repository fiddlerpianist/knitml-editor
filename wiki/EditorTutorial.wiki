= Introduction =
Here is a crash course tutorial for writing patterns in the KnitML Pattern Editor.

= Install an Example =
From the File menu, select "New..." which will pop up a dialog box (it might take a moment). Click on the + sign next to the Examples folder in the list, select the example you want to look at, click the Next button, then Finish. If you don't already have a pattern open, the example pattern will open in the editor.

The current examples are:
  * a simple pattern
  * a stitch sampler
  * a basic sock
  * an advanced sock
  * a lace shawl (Foliage by Emilee Mooney)
  * a sweater (Banff by Jenna Wilson)

= Working with Patterns =
NOTE: when this guide describes control sequences (such as Control-Shift-F), on Macintosh the "control" key is the "Command" key.

== Folding ==
Each pattern has an internal structural outline. Because of this, it understands how to group certain elements defined in your pattern. You can fold up sections you're not interested in viewing by clicking on the + / - icons (with the little circles around them) on the left side of the pattern.

== Formatting ==
Control-Shift-F will format the pattern with indentation and spacing which reflects the pattern's structure.

== Suggestions ==
If you're not sure what to type next, try typing Control-Space anywhere in the pattern. This will give you (hopefully) appropriate suggestions where your cursor is located. Keep in mind this is an area of development, so many of the suggestions may not be optimized yet.

== Errors ==
If the computer can't understand the pattern, you'll get one or more red X marks with a circle in them down the left side. If you move your mouse over one of these marks, a little bubble will pop up with description of the error. If a light bulb appears underneath the red X, the editor has some suggestions for fixing the error. You can click on the light bulb and select a suggestion (if appropriate).

Some errors, such as syntax errors, occur as you type. Some errors (such as errors that occur when test knitting the pattern) occur only when you save the pattern.

== Keystrokes ==
These are common among many text editors.
Control-S: save the pattern
Control-F: find / replace
Control-C: copy
Control-X: cut
Control-V: paste
Right click (a.k.a. secondary click): pop-up menu with additional options
