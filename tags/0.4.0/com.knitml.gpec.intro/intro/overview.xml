			<text>The KnitML Pattern Editor helps you create knitting
				patterns the
				way you want them to look. Whether you prefer charts or written
				instructions, international or U.S. measurements, large fonts or
				small fonts, or a pattern written in your native language and
				conventions, the Pattern Editor can create a pattern that's tailored
				to your needs. It can even provide advice about the knitting the
				pattern at a different gauge.
			</text>
			<text>Patterns in the editor look very similar to published knitting
				patterns in books, magazines, and yarn stores. This makes it both
				easy to understand and to copy and paste existing patterns into the
				editor.
			</text>
			<text>If you are a designer, you can begin constructing patterns with
				the editor instead of with a layout program. As you build the
				pattern, the editor provides feedback and alerts you to problems
				(such as if an operation is out of place or the stitch count doesn't
				match what's expected). At the end of the design, you can choose to
				manually lay out the pattern if you prefer, or you can generate one
				or more versions of your pattern using your preferences from the
				editor and publish them together. If you also provide the source
				from the editor, knitters who use the pattern can tailor it to their
				own preferences.
			</text>
			<text>The Pattern Editor is written to conform to the KnitML
				Specification, an emerging standard to express the semantics of
				knitting patterns.
