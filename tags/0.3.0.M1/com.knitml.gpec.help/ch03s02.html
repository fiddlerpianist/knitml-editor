The
          pattern is for a simple 4x4 in square knitted in stockinette stitch.</p><p>Create a file name <code class="code">simple-square.kel</code>. We will start by defining the
            <code class="code">pattern</code> element, the root element for all KnitML patterns. Since we're not
          internationalizing this pattern, we'll specify that it was written in <code class="code">'en'</code>
          (the ISO-639 Language Code for English).</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {}</pre><p>Next, we'll add some header information about the pattern to a
            <code class="code">generalInformation</code> element within the <code class="code">pattern</code>
          element.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  GeneralInformation {}
}</pre><p>Let's give the pattern a name. Name, description, author, etc. go under
            <code class="code">generalInformation</code>. Anything that should be interpreted as a literal value
          (for instance, a string of text) should be in single quotes.</p><p>
          </p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  GeneralInformation {
    Name: 'Simple Square'
    Description: 'A simple square'
    Dimensions: '4 in by 4 in'
  }
}</pre><p>
        </p><p>Gauge also goes here. We'll indicate that the gauge swatch should be knit in
          stockinette at 6 stitches to the inch and 6 rows to the inch.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  GeneralInformation {
    Name: 'Simple Square'
    Description: 'A simple square'
    Dimensions: '4 in by 4 in'
    Gauge 'stockinette' {
      StitchGauge: 6 stitchesPerInch
      RowGauge: 6 rowsPerInch
    }
  }
}</pre><p>The
          colon after the function name is optional. It increases readability in this case<sup>[<a name="d0e474" href="#ftn.d0e474" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>.</p><p>Let's move on to the next section. We also need some supplies to knit this pattern.
          Generally a knitter needs needles and yarn, and needs to know what type of each the
          pattern calls for. In this case, we're not particularly picky about the yarn (as long as
          it is plausible for obtaining gauge). The only thing we are going to specify is that the
          weight should be worsted. Likewise, we are going to specify using a size US 4 circular
          needle of any length.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  GeneralInformation { ... }
  Supplies {
    Yarns {
      YarnType 'the-yarn' [weight:'worsted']
    }
    Needles {
      needleType 'size-4' circular { size: 4 US }
      needle 'the-needle' [typeref:'size-4']
    }
  }
}</pre><p>First
          we added a <code class="code">yarns</code> sub-element to the supplies element. This is where the yarns
          that will be used in the pattern are defined. Both yarn types (e.g. brand, weight, etc.)
          and yarn colors of a specific type may appear. In this case, we are only using one type of
          yarn (with an identifier of 'worsted-weight-yarn' so that we can refer to it later in the
          pattern if need be). As we don't care about color, there are no <code class="code">yarn</code> elements
          to define.</p><p>Similarly, we have a needles element where all of the needles that will be used in the
          pattern are defined. Both needle types (e.g. DPN, circular, and other attributes) and
          number of needles of a particular needle type must be defined. Here we define one needle
          type we're identifying as 'size-4'. It's a circular needle ('circular') and its size is US
          4. We also define that we need one needle of type 'size-4' and we're going to call that
          needle 'the-needle' (since this project only uses one needle).</p><p>Now we will add directions.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  ...
  Directions {}
}</pre><p>Since our gauge
          is 6 stitches to the inch and we want to knit a 4-inch square, the first thing to do is to
          cast on 24 stitches (6 times 4). You can specify a cast-on method if desired. In this
          case, we'll specify that the knitter should use the long-tail cast on.</p><p>
          </p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  ...
  Directions {
    CastOn 24 'long-tail'
  }
}</pre><p>
        </p><p>Stockinette stitch is a two-row repeat when knitting flat. The first row is all knit,
          and the second is all purled.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  ...
  Directions {
    CastOn 24 'long-tail'
    Row 1: k to end
    Row 2: p to end
  }
}</pre><p>Since
          the project's dimensions should be 4 inches tall as well as wide, we don't want to have to
          write out 22 more rows of the same two rows. So we will declare rows 1 and 2 to be an
          instruction, give that instruction an identifier ('stockinette-st'), and then repeat it a
          certain number of times. In this case, we will repeat the two stockinette rows until the
          project measures 4 inches. KnitML also calculates row numbers for you if not provided, so
          we will remove them.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  ...
  Directions {
    CastOn 24 'long-tail'
    Instruction 'stockinette-st' {
      Row: k to end
      Row: p to end
    }
    Repeat 'stockinette-st' until measures 4 in
  }
}</pre><p>
          <code class="code">until measures</code> are keywords which inform the KnittingEL processor to
          construct the particular XML form when an instruction is repeated to a measurement. There
          are various other keywords in the KnittingEL. See the appendix for a list of them.</p><p>Now that we've reached 4 inches, we will finish the project by binding off all
          stitches.</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  ...
  Directions {
    CastOn 24 'long-tail'
    Instruction 'stockinette-repeat' {
      Row: k to end
      Row: p to end
    }
    Repeat 'stockinette-st' until measures 4 in
    Row: BindOff all sts
  }
}
</pre><p>That's
          all there is to it! The complete pattern looks like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">Pattern 'en' {
  GeneralInformation {
    Name: 'Simple Square'
    Description: 'A simple square'
    Dimensions: '4 in by 4 in'
    Gauge 'stockinette' {
      StitchGauge: 6 stitchesPerInch
      RowGauge: 6 rowsPerInch
    }
  }
  Supplies {
    Yarns {
      YarnType 'the-yarn' [weight:'worsted']
    }
    Needles {
      NeedleType 'size-4' circular { size: 4 US }
      Needle 'the-needle' [typeref:'size-4']
    }
  }
  Directions {
    CastOn 24 'long-tail'
    Instruction 'stockinette-st' {
      Row: k to end
      Row: p to end
    }
    Repeat 'stockinette-st' until measures 4 in
    Row: BindOff all sts
  }
}
</pre><p>If
          you run this through the basic text rendering program, you'll get this:</p><p>
          </p><pre class="programlisting">Simple Square

Directions
----------
Using the long-tail method, cast on 24 stitches.
Row 1: Knit
Row 2: Purl
Repeat rows 1-2 for 4 in.
Row 25: Bind off all stitches</pre><p>
        </p><p>This may not appear to be worth all of the trouble, but keep a few things in mind.
          First of all, the pattern has been "test knit." This means If there were too many or two
          few stitches for any given row, the validator would raise an error. This can be very
          helpful because it can catch certain kinds of errata immediately. The validator also fills
          in missing information as it's being knit. Notice that all of the rows have been assigned numbers.<sup>[<a name="d0e536" href="#ftn.d0e536" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup></p><p>Second, note that our needle size was automatically converted to metric. There are
          various options on the pattern renderer that will allow you to use the system of units
          most familiar to you, regardless of what the original pattern was written in. (Note that
          the pattern renderer does not currently support these options, but it will in a future
          release.)</p><p>Here is the gauge specification in metric:</p><pre class="programlisting">Simple Square
A simple square

Stitch Gauge: 2.4 st/cm
Row Gauge: 2.4 row/cm
...</pre><p>Also
          note that, even though we specified that the pattern is written in English, this pattern
          can (for the most part) be rendered in another language very easily. Simply setting the
          renderer to use Spanish (using pattern conventions from Spain) produces this result:</p><p>

        </p><p>Note that the header information (i.e. the parts of the pattern written in English)
          would always be written in English unless you internationalized them. See <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Internationalization">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Internationalization</i></a> for more information.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.d0e474" href="#d0e474" class="para">2</a>] </sup>Note that using a colon here has a slightly different implication than using it

              row gauge is set to 6 rows per inch, and the repeat was done for 4 inches. That would
              make the next row knit row 25.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Knitting Expression Language&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Improving the Pattern</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
